               <p>The purpose of the following demonstrations and tests is to show
                      scientifically that the features and asymptotic trends of the BigWorld
                      Server described in <a href="ch02.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Architecture Overview"><i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Architecture Overview</i></a> hold true for
                      real world deployments.
                      Analysing real customer deployments as well as scientific test results
                      allows for the creation of estimates for hardware costs for different
                      server deployments as specified in the previous chapter.
               </p>
               <p>It should be noted that in the large-scale tests, game entities
                      running significant Artificial Intelligence (AI) routines were not used.
                      This was a deliberate choice as the variance in complexity and efficiency
                      of AI in a real game is potentially very large, and is determined almost
                      entirely by the design of a given game as opposed to the BigWorld Server.
                      This is also the main reason for the wide variance in CCUs quoted in <a href="ch03.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Case Studies"><i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Case Studies</i></a>. Since these variations are
                      difficult to account for, they were excluded from these tests. As BigWorld
                      already has multiple customers with games in beta and release stages,
                      we have good statistics about the expected behaviour of these
                      factors.

               <p>The data displayed in the following tests was collected using 
                      BigWorld Server tools. The BigWorld server is shipped with a collection of
                      web-enabled tools which are used to monitor and administer the server.
                      The following is a short description of these tools:

                           statistics and writing the results to a MySQL database. These statistics

                  <p>Space Viewer provides a top-down graphical display of entity and
                           cell distributions across a particular space on a BigWorld Server. It
                           consists of a daemon and a GUI app written in Python.
                           The daemon polls the server for cell data and writes the
                           data to a logfile. The GUI application connects to the daemon
                           process via TCP and requests cell data for any time within the log
                           period.

                           <p>Space Viewer showing three cells</p></span></div>
                  </div>
                  <p>Space Viewer displays cell boundaries as blue lines, and entities
                           as small circles, coloured by type. The green grid lines indicate the
                           boundaries of the chunks that comprise the 3D world data.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each cell is labelled with its ID, IP address, and its current
                           load (represented as a float value 0 to 1.).
                  </p>
                  <p>Space Viewer can also display the rough entity extents for each
                           cell (represented here by the cyan rectangles). This is useful for
                           getting an idea of the distribution of entities in a large multi-cell
                           system. It is not feasible to record and display the position of every individual
                           entity in systems of this size, and as such Space Viewer only supports
                           tracking entities on a single cell at a time. In the example above, Cell
                           4 is selected and we can see the individual entities within its
                           boundaries (the coloured circles) and the ghost entities near its
                           boundaries (the greyed out circles).

                  <p>The technique used to generate server load in our testing
                           procedures is via a set of <em class="emphasis">"bot"</em> processes. A
                           single Bot process provides the ability to establish multiple client
                           connections to a server with a low memory / CPU overhead for each
                           connection, as opposed to a GUI client which is generally far more
                           resource intensive. The client connections established via a Bot process
                           are capable of all the same actions as a GUI client and receive the same
                           network traffic/events.
                  </p>
                  <p>Bots are a valuable load generation technique because they allow
                           the simulation of huge numbers of concurrently connected clients with a
                           relatively small amount of hardware dedicated to the load generation
                           itself, while still providing an accurate and realistic test of the
                           server. Since the server makes no distinction between bots and real
                           (GUI) clients, the load on the server is an accurate reflection of the
                           load generated by an equivalent number of real clients.
                  </p>
                  <p>Bots should be used by developers to test their games during the
                           development cycle and towards the beta stages. It is a useful tool to
                           evaluate the effect of new features and optimisations by directly
                           comparing load statistics for a given set of entities to a
                           baseline.

                     <p>This test aimed to verify the server's ability to handle extreme
                                volumes of concurrent players in a single shard, and to
                                determine the maximum number of clients that could be connected on the
                                available hardware. The test was performed on IBM Test Cluster 1 by
                                adding bots to a 40km x 40km square region of a single space.
                     </p>
                     <p>It is important to note that the only entities in the game world
                                were client entities; there were no NPCs spawned. As far as server
                                load is concerned, this test should yield overly conservative
                                estimates of the server's ability to handle large volumes of entities.
                                The cost of a client entity on the server is (in general) greater than
                                an NPC entity because updates of entities around a client entity must
                                be sent down to the client, whereas this is not true of NPCs. For
                                example, using the FantasyDemo world that is bundled with the BigWorld
                                server, the cost ratio of a client entity to a Guard NPC (who is
                                constantly patrolling and watching for attacks on other Guards) is
                                roughly 4:1. Guards are considered to be
                                <em class="emphasis">heavy-weight</em> NPCs, as they are constantly pathing
                                and run AI routines. Examples of <em class="emphasis">light-weight</em>
                                NPCs would be shop-keepers, mission-givers, and other NPCs who don't
                                move much and mostly react to player actions as opposed to acting of
                                their own volition. We would expect these <em class="emphasis">dumb</em>
                                NPCs to cost 1/20th of a client entity or even less.
                     </p>
                     <p>In a typical game world containing both client entities and
                                NPCs, the majority of CPU time is consumed in the formation and
                                sending of downstream packets for client entities; therefore, as
                                client entities are empirically more expensive than NPCs, and provided
                                that the NPC AI isn't excessive, it is expected that there can be many
                                NPCs for the cost of one client entity in a typical game.

                     <p>The entity bounds shown above indicate that the clients are

                                1,600km<sup>2</sup>. Each entity has an Area of
                                Interest (AoI) radius of 500m, which means each is aware of entities
                                in the square kilometre surrounding it. For 100,000 entities spread
                                over 1,600km<sup>2</sup>, this equates to about 62
                                entities in the AoI of each client, which is a reasonable number of
                                entities for each player to be aware of for a standard World of

                                we can see that the space is distributed uniformly into cells:

                                of the star and its centre. The important thing to notice here is that
                                even with a shifting entity distribution (and cell layout), the
                                minimum and maximum loads differ from the average load by less than

                                automatically used more cells (purple line) and kept the average load

                                to each client was being utilised. This allows us to show that the

                                             another Cell to start taking on its excess load to relieve it.
                                             This means that clients will temporarily receive updates less
                                             frequently per-entity, but the server state is kept stable.

                                space, the load on the first CellApp moves toward the lower
                                equilibrium state where both cells have equal load:

                     <p>The above example is a typical example of how first level fault
                                tolerance works. There is little disruption to the flow of game play
                                on the client (it feels like a short lag spike) and the game state is
                                preserved accurately. We have illustrated that in the event of a Cell
                                failure, neighbouring Cells assume responsibility over the space and
                                containing entities that previously resided on the failed Cell. After
                                a short time, the average load of each Cell 
                                increases to a level that is inversely proportional to the number of
                                available Cells allocated to that space. Therefore, having more
                                available CellApps improves the fault tolerance by spreading failed
                                Cells' load over more available Cells. This reduces the duration of
                                scaleback observed by players.
