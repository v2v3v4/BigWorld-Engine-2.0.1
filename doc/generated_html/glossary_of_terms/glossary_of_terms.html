  BigWorld documents:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><em class="emphasis">AOI</em></p><p>or, Area Of Interest: the physical region in which an entity is
      interested.</p><p>Typically, this is a vertically oriented cylinder with a radius of
      500 metres around the entity.</p><p>The length of the radius is also known as the ghost distance,
      because it matches the distance between an entity and a nearby cell in
      which the entity needs to be ghosted. For more details, see the document
      <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#Server_Overview" class="olink">Server Overview</a>'s section <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Server_Components" class="olink"><i>Server Components</i></a> <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Server_Components_CellApp" class="olink">CellApp</a> <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Real_And_Ghost_Entities" class="olink">Real and Ghost Entities</a>.</p><p>The distance should be slightly larger than the distance that an
      avatar can see.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Area of Interest</em></p><p>See AOI.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Avatar</em></p><p>An entity associated with a character. This may be a Player
      Character (PC) or a Non-Player Character (NPC).</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Base</em></p><p>An object used to represent the part of an entity that does not
      move.</p><p>Unlike the part of an entity on a cell, which can move between
      different machines, a base does not move, thus giving a fixed location
      to talk to the entity.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Bundle</em></p><p>A bundle is a collection of messages. It maps to one or more UDP
      packets.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Call</em></p><p>A type of event: a remote method invocation. Differs from other
      types of event in that a call is made directly on a known object.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Camera</em></p><p>A camera is a view into the world. Cameras have a position and a
      viewing direction, stored in a matrix.</p><p>There are a number of cameras that move in different ways, but
      exactly one must be active for each frame.</p><p>The active camera matrix is communicated to the 3D Engine (Moo)
      before drawing the frame.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Chunk</em></p><p>The terrain, scene, and collision scene are split up into chunks
      that are loaded when necessary.</p><p>At every frame, the client determines if any unloaded chunks may
      soon be visible, and instructs the loading thread to load them. Chunks
      are also disposed when no longer needed so the memory they use can be
      reclaimed.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Chunking</em></p><p>Term used for the concept of breaking the world into connected
      pieces.</p><p>It is usually used when talking about rendering the scene or
      loading world data, e.g.: 'The chunking of the terrain allows it to load
      faster.'</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Collision scene</em></p><p>The collision scene contains a representation of the space that is
      used in physics calculations, in particular for calculating collisions
      between moving objects and the scenery, and querying properties about
      the point of impact.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Console</em></p><p>A console is a layer of text drawn over the scene and the GUI.
      Consoles are mainly used for debugging, but can also be used by
      scripts.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Detail object</em></p><p>A detail object is a small mesh drawn in large numbers onto the
      terrain around the camera position. They are separated from ordinary
      models for efficiency. The selection and placement of these objects is
      largely automatic, based on the texture of the underlying
      terrain.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Entity</em></p><p>An entity is the basic addressable object in the BigWorld system.
      The messages, sent between the BigWorld server and client, are all in
      the context of some entity.</p><p>Entities have a type and a position, and a number of other
      properties determined by the type. Each entity type has a Python script
      class associated with it, and each entity instance in the world has an
      instance of its Python class to control it.</p><p>Entities have no intrinsic representation in the world; rather
      their controlling script explicitly adds objects to the scene under the
      entity's authority.</p><p>The BigWorld client presents a rich scripting environment for the
      implementation of entities, by exposing powerful classes and objects as
      Python types and modules. For more details, see the document <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#Server_Overview" class="olink">Server Overview</a>'s section <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Server_Components" class="olink"><i>Server Components</i></a> <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Server_Components_CellApp" class="olink">CellApp</a> <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#xref_Scripting_And_Entities" class="olink">Scripting and Entities</a>.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Event</em></p><p>A remote method invocation (see Call) or a property update.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Ghost</em></p><p>A non-authoritative representation of a real object.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">GUI element</em></p><p>A range of Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements may also exist
      in the world, without being added to the scene, but being overlaid after
      the scene is drawn.</p><p>Scripts have access to these elements.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Light</em></p><p>A light is a scene object that illuminates models. Like models,
      lights must be in the scene to have an effect. Scripts also have access
      to lights.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Message</em></p><p>A message represents a single event or call.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Model</em></p><p>A model is a mesh, possibly attached to a skeleton that can be
      drawn in the world.</p><p>Models often have animations (especially those with skeletons),
      which affect the configuration of the mesh. In order for a model to be
      properly updated and drawn, it must be put into the scene.</p><p>Entity scripts make use of models (often just one) to represent
      themselves in the world.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Object</em></p><p>The most general concept of a thing in the game. For example, a
      button or an object that represents a team are examples of objects. It
      maps to the C++ concept of an object.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Particle system</em></p><p>A particle system displays a moving and changing set of particles.
      These do not exist in the scene by themselves, but are attached to a
      model instead.</p><p>Scripts also have access to particle systems, and can construct a
      great variety of graphical effects by specifying the rules for a
      system.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Personality script</em></p><p>The personality script is a global script that determines the
      game-specific top-level behaviour of the client, base and cell
      applications. It remains in scope for the entire running of the
      application, so for example on the client, regardless of changes in the
      active player, the personality script remains the same.</p><p>The main job for personality scripts is to handle global events,
      for example for initialisation, the handling of input events, or
      responding to when a server process has fully started up, or the
      geometry is fully mapped. Additional tasks that are appropriate for the
      personality script are tasks such as managing the active camera, and
      handling global user interface features such as a chat console.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Player</em></p><p>The player is the special name given to the entity controlled by
      the user. This entity is usually an avatar.</p><p>This is the only entity that the BigWorld server will let the
      client control - attempts to control others will be denied by the
      server.</p><p>Also, the client bandwidth (data coming from the server) allocated
      to each entity is proportional to that entity's proximity to the
      client's player entity. For details on bandwidth management and load
      balancing, see the document <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="../server_overview/server_overview.html#Server_Overview" class="olink">Server Overview</a>.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Player script</em></p><p>Each entity type that might become a player also provides a player
      script in Python as a class that inherits from the ordinary Python
      entity class.</p><p>The player script has the important job of handling the user input
      and graphical feedback specific to that player type. This involves
      everything from entity movement (on the input side) to the display of
      the current item (on the graphical feedback side). A number of C++
      classes are provided as Python types to aid the player script in these
      duties.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Portal</em></p><p>Chunks are connected to each other through portals.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Real</em></p><p>The authoritative representation of an object (at least within the
      scope of the cells).</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Scene</em></p><p>The scene is a concept encompassing the majority of objects that
      have a three-dimensional physical manifestation in the world.</p><p>The static base of the scene can be constructed using tools such
      as WorldEditor. Other scene objects are added dynamically based on
      information from the server.</p><p>The scene is sometimes referred to as the scene graph.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">Terrain</em></p><p>The terrain is the primary geometric object that gives overall
      form to the surface of the world. Most other objects in the world are
      placed on top of the terrain.</p><p>It is implemented as a large contiguous height-mapped mesh,
      partitioned into chunks for efficient processing.</p><p>Textures are applied to the terrain and are merged using alpha
      blending.</p></li><li><p><em class="emphasis">World</em></p><p>The world refers to the entire scene, and is made up of many
      diverse components such as chunks, terrain, camera, and entities.</p><p>Most of these components are updated and drawn at every frame.
      More importantly, the world defines a fixed geographic reference frame,
      as opposed to the camera or objects, which have their own movable
      reference frames.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
