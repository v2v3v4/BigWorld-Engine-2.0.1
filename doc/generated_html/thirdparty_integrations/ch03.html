               <p>Scaleform GFx is a third party Flash rendering library produced by
                      Scaleform (<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.scaleform.com" target="_top">http://www.scaleform.com/</a>).
                      Scaleform is not provided as part of the BigWorld Technology license and
                      needs to be licensed seperately if required.
               </p>
               <p>BigWorld Technology is integrated with Mozilla using llmozlib which
                      allows showing web pages and Flash movies as part of the game but this
                      solution is less efficient than Scaleform and therefore not suitable for
                      game user interfaces.
               </p>
               <p>Scaleform provides a hardware accelerated renderer for Flash movies
                      suitable for use in games. BigWorld has implemented an integration with
                      Scaleform allowing Flash movies to be displayed, and controlled by
                      Python.
               </p>
               <p>Scaleform IME is an optional add-on for Scaleform customers,
                      allowing display of an in-game Scaleform IME movie to replace the windows
                      IME language bar. BigWorld has integrated against Scaleform IME as
                      well.
               </p>
               <p>While Scaleform has tried its best to optimise rendering of Flash
                      movies, there are still a number of guidelines that artists should follow
                      in order to create Flash movies that behave well and don't bog down
                      performance unnecessarily. It is therefore essential that you read the
                      appropriate Scaleform documentation before launching into full-scale
                      production of Flash movies for use with your BigWorld game.
               </p>
               <p>This document describes how to display and use a Flash movie in
                      BigWorld. It describes the changes required to the client to build in the
                      Scaleform integration. It then describes how to use the Python API to
                      display and manipulate a Flash movie. Finally it describes some
                      BigWorld-specific features and limitations.

               <p>In order to build the client with support for Scaleform, you must
                      download and install the SDK (version 3). The installer will create an
                      environment variable called <code class="code">GFXSDK</code> which is used by the
                      BigWorld client solution to locate the SDK installation. You can check
                      that the environment variable is correctly set by opening a command prompt
                      and entering the command <code class="code">set GFXSDK</code>. It should print out the
                      root installation path of the Scaleform SDK.

               <p>This section aims to show you how to load up a Flash movie and
                      display it in your game's user interface. There are two approaches to
                      achieving this. The first approach involves displaying a global movie
                      which bypasses the BigWorld GUI system completely. The second approach
                      involves showing a Scaleform movie within a BigWorld GUI tree. It is
                      recommended to use the second approach, but for simplicity and to get up
                      and running quickly you can display a flash movie as part of a global
                      flash movie list.

                  <p>The simplest way to display a flash movie is to load a Movie
                           Definition File (representing a .swf file), create a view of that (Movie
                           View) and display the movie. This type of movie will always handle key
                           and mouse inputs, and will always display at the full size of the client
                           window. Note that just like any other resources loading in BigWorld,
                           Scaleform resources must exist within your resource paths. Any attempts
                           to load a flash file from outside of your specified resource paths will
                           throw a Python IOError Exception.

                  <p>In the above example, two objects were created, a Movie Definition
                           and a Movie View. Both of these are Python objects that internally
                           maintain a reference to one or more Scaleform C++ objects. As a game
                           programmer, all you need to know is that as long as you keep your Python
                           objects alive, the underlying Scaleform objects are kept alive too.
                           Here's a code snippet that demonstrates the lifetime of these two Python
                           objects :
                  </p><pre class="programlisting">#movieDef, movieView attributes created in the above example

# First we will free the movie definition.
del movieDef

# The Movie View will still play, however in future if you require a new view of that movie, you'll have to reload the entire movie.

# Now free the movie view.
del movieView

# Notice that deleting the movieView object means it is no longer displaying</pre><p>If
                           you hold onto Scaleform objects after the Personality Script is
                           fini'd(), then you will run into problems, as the Scaleform subsytem is
                           shut down before Python. When Python is shut down, it frees all its
                           outstanding objects, and the Python-controlled Scaleform objects will be
                           released too late, causing an assert. It is up to you to make sure you
                           release these objects before shutdown.
                  </p>

                  </div>
                  <p>In the first example, the movieView created was displayed as part
                           of a simple, global list of movies. In practice, you may want to mix
                           BigWorld GUI objects and Scaleform movies, for example, to embed a
                           Scaleform movie within a moveable window, or to pop up a Scaleform movie
                           like an Inventory display in the HUD.
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to do this, you simply wrap the MovieView object in a
                           Flash GUI Component. Once you do this, the GUI object takes control over
                           the lifetime, display, size, position and input handling for your
                           movie.

                     <p>If you attach a script object to a FlashGUIComponent, you have
                                to pass input events through to the MovieView yourself. This allows
                                the script to filter events before they get passed through. For
                                example, the following snippet passes through all input events except
                                the escape key which is handled as a special case:

               <p>No doubt you will want to build complex UI's in Flash that interact
                      with your BigWorld game, sending and receiving events and swapping data
                      back and forth. All method and data interactions are handled via the
                      PyMovieView Python object. This chapter details a number of different ways
                      to interact with your Flash movie and its action script.

                           <code class="function">fscommand()</code> call was the way to call out from
                           Action Script and into its container. <code class="function">fscommand()</code>
                           is supported by Scaleform and BigWorld. In order to handle
                           <code class="function">fscommand()</code> calls, you simply register a Python
                           callback function to handle any such calls :
                  </p><pre class="programlisting">def myFSCommandHandler( cmd, arg ):
    # cmd, arg are both strings.  Dispatch to wherever is appropriate.

movieView.setFSCommandCallback( myFSCommandHandler )</pre></div>

                  </div>
                  <p>In later versions of Action Script, external interface is used
                           instead to call out of Action Script and into the containing
                           application. External Interface calls have the advantage of allowing
                           different types and number of arguments to be passed around (instead of
                           fscommand supporting only a single string argument). Additionally, the
                           container can set return values for the external interface call. Usage
                           is similar to handling fscommand, however the callback function has a
                           different interface :
                  </p><pre class="programlisting">def myExternalInterfaceHandler( cmd, *args ):
    # cmd is still a string, but now we have a list of arguments, with arbitrary types.  Dispatch to wherever is appropriate

                  <p>Action Script variables tend to be buried in a hierarchy, often
                           looking like : <span class="literal">"_root.levelN.someVariableName"</span>.
                           Unfortunately this syntax is misinterpreted by Python and currently
                           there is no elegant solution to work around this. However it is still
                           easy to exchange data with Action Script. All that is required is to use
                           Python's <code class="function">setattr</code> and <code class="function">getattr</code>
                           syntax. For example:
                  </p><pre class="programlisting">setattr( movieView, "_root.level0.maxHealth", 10 )
currentHealth = getattr( movieView, "_root.level0.health" )</pre><p>Using this syntax you can get and set any of the following types
                           of data : boolean, int, floats, string and unicode string.
