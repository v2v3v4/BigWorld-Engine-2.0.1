            <p>Mailboxes to entities residing on a BaseApp should exist for as long
               as they are needed. However, these same entities may be player entities
               controlled by the BigWorld client. These two different usages need to be
               reconciled when it comes to managing entity lifetimes &#8212; for example, if the
               client disconnects while the game's web interface is still using the
               player's base entity, this entity should not be destructed until the game's
                 web interface has finished with it.
            </p>
            <p>Another example is if the player is currently not logged in via the
                 BigWorld client. If the player does not explicitly log out, we would want to
                 clean up that mailbox reference after an inactivity period.
            </p>
            <p>A solution to this problem is to use a keep-alive interval for
                 mailboxes that require it, so that the entity stays around even if the
                 client has disconnected (destruction of the base entity is the normal course
                 of action). If a keep-alive interval is set on a mailbox, then each time a
                 method is called on that mailbox, it causes the keep-alive interval for that
                 entity to be refreshed.
            </p>
            <p>When a base entity enters a keep-alive interval, the base entity
                 script method <code class="methodname">onKeepAliveStart()</code> is called. When
                 the keep-alive interval expires without any refreshing from the web
                 integration gateway, it is assumed to be no longer required, and so
                 <code class="methodname">onKeepAliveStop()</code> is called in Python script. The
                 base entity script should decide whether it is still required, and should
                 destroy itself.
            </p>
            <p>Keep-alive intervals can be used with HTTP session timeouts so that
                 players have to re-login after a certain inactivity period to create a new
                 HTTP session. Keep-alive intervals should be set to be equal to session
                 durations or longer.
