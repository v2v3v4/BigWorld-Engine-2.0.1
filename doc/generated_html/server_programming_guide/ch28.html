                      and the sensitivity of game data in today's online games, a standard
                      implementation is now included with BigWorld.

                  <p>Packet filters do not allow arbitrary encryption algorithms to be
                           used <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> the algorithm implemented
                           must work within the mechanics of Mercury. Mercury processes each data
                           packet individually, and has mechanisms for coping with packet loss and
                           similar problems. Since packet filters are called as the last stage of
                           sending a packet, and as the first stage of receiving a packet,
                           algorithms implemented within a packet filter should work under the
                           normal constraints of UDP, which are:
                  </p>
                  <div class="itemizedlist">
                     <ul type="disc">
                        <li>
                           <p>Packets may be delivered out of order.</p>
                        </li>

                  </div>
                  <p>For this reason, encryption algorithms that assume a continuous
                           transport byte stream are not appropriate. The appropriate encryption
                           algorithms are the ones that work on a single block (packet) at a time
                           within a window, and include algorithms like DES block encryption (as
                           used in the secure PPP protocol), Blowfish, TwoFish, or similar
                           protocols used in wireless Ethernet technology (SSL is not appropriate,
                           since it assumes a continuous stream). The previously mentioned block
                           algorithms can support packet loss and prevent packet replayability,
                           among other features.
                  </p>
                  <p>Mercury takes care of the particulars of a UDP environment <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> the packet filter only has to perform
                           its filtering function. It uses sequence numbers of its own to discard
                           duplicate packets (assuming that the packet filter itself has not
                           discarded the packet). It also detects dropped packets, and resends them
                           if they contained reliable information (so the packet filter should not
                           do this). When Mercury needs to resend messages, it will sometimes
                           resend the whole packet unmodified, and at other times (if there is
                           space) it will piggyback just the reliable messages of the dropped
                           packet into the body of the next new packet. Packet filters must be able
                           to cope with both of these types of resending.
                  </p>
                  <p>Packet filters are always associated with channels, like the ones
                           between a proxy and a client.

                           Similarly, the <span class="literal">recv</span> method of the
                           <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> instance is called for every packet that
                           is received over the channel by the Nub, before any other processing
                           occurs on it. This method should undo any modifications made to the
                           packet by the <span class="literal">send</span> method, and then call the base
                           class <span class="literal">PacketFilter::recv</span> method.
                  </p>
                  <p>Since packets may be received out of order, the
                           <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> instance must be able to reconstruct any
                           packet received within the <span class="literal">Channel</span>'s window.
                           Duplicate packets may also be received, and these must also be
                           reconstructed when within the window, so that they can be acknowledged
                           (in case the ACK for the original packet was lost).
                  </p>
                  <p>Note that a <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> must not modify a
                           packet to be sent <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> or at least if
                           it does so, it then must undo the modifications afterwards. If it were
                           to leave a packet modified, and that packet needed to be resent (or
                           partially resent), then it would be filtering the data twice. Depending
                           on the nature of the modifications being made to the
                           <span class="literal">Packet</span>'s data, it may make sense to do the desired
                           changes, or it may make more sense to simply grab a new
                           <span class="literal">Packet</span> from the <span class="literal">PacketPool</span>, write
                           the filtered data to that packet, and then send it. This notice does not
                           apply to packets that are received <span class="symbol">&#8208;</span> the <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> may
                           modify received packets in-place if it so chooses, especially if it is
                           efficient to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>The <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> base class'
                           <span class="literal">send</span> implementation sends the packets over the Nub's
                           socket with the usual accounting, error checking, and retries.
                  </p>
                  <p>Do not use the Nub's socket directly. The
                           <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> base class' <span class="literal">recv</span>
                           implementation submits the packet for normal internal processing. If you
                           do not call it, then you must give the packet back to the
                           <span class="literal">PacketPool</span> (with
                           <span class="literal"><span class="literal">PacketPool::give</span></span>), or the packet
                           will be leaked.
                  </p>
                  <p>New packets may be obtained and old ones returned at any time via
                           the <span class="literal">PacketPool</span> object.
                           <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span> instances may use and store packets for
                           any purpose that they see fit. Also, the <span class="literal">PacketFilter</span>
                           base class' methods <span class="literal">send</span> and <span class="literal">recv</span>
                           may be called as many times as desired from the corresponding derived
                           methods <span class="literal">send</span> and <span class="literal">recv</span>, if that is
                           what the filter needs to do.
