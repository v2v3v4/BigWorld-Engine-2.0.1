                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="classname">Proxy</code> on the
                      BaseApp extends
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="classname">Base</code> to support
                      player-controlled entities. By deriving an entity from
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="classname">Proxy</code>, you can
                      implement player characters, their accounts, and any other relevant
                      player-controlled objects on the server.
               </p>
               <p>An entity derived from
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="classname">Proxy</code> is created
                      from the database whenever a client logs in to the server. For details on
                      how BigWorld determines which Proxy to load, see <a href="ch20.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;20.&nbsp;User Authentication and Billing System Integration"><i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">User Authentication and Billing System Integration</i></a>. Proxies created
                      in this way (see below for other ways of creating proxies) which have a
                      property called <code class="varname">password</code>, will have the value of that
                      property set to the login password.
               </p>
               <p>An instance of
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="classname">Proxy</code> needs neither
                      a cell entity, nor a client one. A proxy entity can be created using the
                      method
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="methodname">createBase</code>, just
                      like any other entity. For more detail on this method, see <a href="ch07.html#xref_Entity_Instantiation_On_The_BaseApp" title="7.1.&nbsp;Entity Instantiation on the BaseApp">Entity Instantiation on the BaseApp</a>.
               </p>
               <p>Like other base entities, saving and loading proxy entities from the
                      database is possible. Initially, these reloaded proxy entities will be
                      created without an attached client. An existing proxy can later hand its
                      client over to the reloaded one, in which case the reloaded proxy will be
                      the one handling the client connection.
               </p>
               <p>This allows you to have, for example, an
                      <code class="classname">Account</code> entity that people can log in to, and a
                      <code class="classname">Character</code> entity that people can select from a menu
                      in order to use in the game.
               </p>
               <p>To pass the control of a client from one proxy to another, use the
                      method <code class="methodname">giveClientTo</code>, as in the example
                      below:
               </p><pre class="programlisting">clientControlledProxy.giveClientTo( nonClientControlledProxy )</pre><p>Whenever a client moves between proxies, or the cell entity of the
                      proxy that a client is attached to is destroyed, the client receives a
                      call on <code class="methodname">onEntitiesReset</code> to clear out its current
                      knowledge of the world. This effectively interrupts all game
                      communications, and forces the client to refresh. If only the cell entity
                      has been destroyed, then the client's knowledge of its proxy is
                      retained.
               </p>
               <p>If <code class="methodname">giveClientTo</code> does not succeed because of
                      a problem with the destination proxy,
                      <code class="methodname">onGiveClientToFailure</code> will be called on the
                      origin proxy.

               <p>By default, every cell entity is considered to be controlled by the
                      server. When an entity incorporates a witness object, it is considered to
                      be controlled by the client attached to the corresponding proxy.
               </p>
               <p>However, the control of an entity may be explicitly assigned and
                      queried, using the entity attribute .<code class="varname">controlledBy</code>. This
                      attribute may be set to <span class="literal">None</span>, to indicate server
                      control, or to a <code class="classname">BaseEntityMailBox</code> to indicate
                      control by the client attached to that proxy. Within this context, control
                      implies ownership of and responsibility for the entity's position and
                      direction. Clients (and proxies) are informed of changes to the set of
                      entities that they are allowed to control. Proxies may read this set
                      through their attribute wards.

                      however this may not always be appropriate. For example, if the gravity of
                      your game environment enables a Y-axis acceleration that results in a top
                      speed exceeding the maximum allowable X/Z-axis top speed. In order to
                      accommodate this there is a secondary attribute named
                      <code class="classname">Entity</code>.<code class="varname">topSpeedY</code> which takes
                      precedence when set to a value greater than zero.
                      <code class="varname">topSpeedY</code> will only be used when both

                        <p>The first check is regarding the speed, to ensure that it does
                                   not exceed <code class="varname">topSpeed</code> and
                                   <code class="varname">topSpeedY</code>. There is a small amount of variance
                                   allowed in speed to account for up to 150ms of network jitter. Care is
                                   taken so that this <em class="emphasis">latency debt</em> is not exploited
                                   by allowing the player to travel faster than the top speed for a brief
                                   period of time.

                                   well-defined portal.

                        <p>In spite of being very fast, this check does have consequences
                                   for level design. Barriers that control character mobility must be
                                   represented at the level of chunks. For example, a chunk with a wall
                                   across it, and a door giving access to the other side, is not
                                   protected by this physics checking system. In order to implement this
                                   in a manner to enable physics validation, two chunks should be used
                                   one on each side of the wall, with the door as a portal between
                                   them.

                        </p>
                        <p>To install a custom physics validator, a CellApp extension
                                   module must be written. During the initialisation of the extension
                                   module, the global function pointer
                                   <code class="varname">g_customPhysicsValidator</code> (declared in
                                   <code class="filename">bigworld/src/server/cellapp/entity.hpp</code>) should be
                                   set to point to the custom physics validator function. For more

               <p>When a server script directly sets the position or direction of an
                      entity that is controlled by a client, the CellApp treats that as a
                      physics correction. A new position and direction (sometimes referred to as
                      the <em class="emphasis">pose</em>) are forced down to the client, and no
                      future position and direction updates are accepted until the correction is
                      acknowledged. This feature can be very useful for teleporting a player in
                      response to some action or event on the server. Notably, the methods
                      <code class="classname">Entity</code>.<code class="methodname">teleport</code>,
                      <code class="classname">Entity</code>.<code class="methodname">boardVehicle</code> and
                      <code class="classname">Entity</code>.<code class="methodname">alightVehicle</code> also
                      adhere to this mechanism. Server-side teleports are the only way to move
                      an entity between spaces.
               </p>
               <p>While in most cases movement controllers would also result in
                      downstream-forced positions, their use on client-controlled entities is
                      neither recommended nor supported, since they continually set the position
                      via a system intended for one-off adjustments.

                  <p>Due to the manner in which physics validation occurs, if a top
                           speed has been exceeded, the server will force a position update to the
                           client with the last known valid position. This however has the
                           unfortunate side effect of producing an entity which doesn't fall if the
                           top speed has been exceeded in the Y-axis. Setting the
                           <code class="varname">topSpeedY</code> to be higher than
                           <code class="varname">topSpeed</code> will help in this situation, but eventually,
                           the Y-velocity will be greater than <code class="varname">topSpeedY</code> due to
                           acceleration due to gravity when falling for long periods.
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to produce a work around for this, it is recommended to
                           write a custom physics validator while setting a large value for
                           <code class="varname">topSpeedY</code>. The custom physics validator could then
                           perform its own validation and update the entity position with a
                           decreasing Y-position prior to returning <span class="literal">false</span>, and
                           the updated position would then be forced to the client.
