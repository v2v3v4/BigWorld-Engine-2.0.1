            <p>Profiling the server can take on a number of forms depending on the
                 stage of development you are in and what kind of issues you are attempting
                 to isolate. The following list is a brief outline of the different areas you
                 may wish to profile.

                     <p><em class="emphasis">Entities</em></p>
                     <p>Entities are the main game object which are used by all components
                              of the BigWorld engine. Inefficient or bloated entities can cause
                              excessive load and network communication on your server processes which
                              will reduce the overall performance of your server cluster. This in turn
                              can affect the total number of active users your server can
                              support.
                     </p>

                     <p>Python script represents the majority of custom game code and as
                              such is one of the most variable sources of load that is placed on the
                              BigWorld server processes. Profiling Python script should be performed
                              on a semi-regular basis and preferably while performing load tests in
                              order to ensure that there are no major bottlenecks in your
                              script.

                     <p>As the BigWorld server processes are the core of a server cluster
                              that run custom script and game code, it can be useful to identify which
                              areas of the server processes are under load. This can help to pinpoint
                              issues in either game script, navigation issues, network communication,
                              entity management or any of the other numerous tasks that are handled by
                              the server processes.

                              server processes, it can be useful to identify which network messages
                              are causing the most load on each process.

            <p>We recommend you run profiles regularly while you are developing or
                 making changes to configuration, etc. as you can see what effect a change
                 can make. You should keep the profiles that you generate to use as a
                 historical reference for your games performance over the development life.
                 For example, if you make a script change, and suddenly cell load is quite
                 high, you can use the profiles to see when this load spike started and
                 narrow down the cause of the issue to script usage as well as the particular
                 methods causing the script load spike.

               <p>The best mechanism currently in place for profiling entity sizes is
                      the usage of the WebConsole filtered watchers view to collect information
                      about the impact of each entity type's properties, coupled with a peer
                      review system to ensure that multiple people have an understanding of the

                  <p>Persistent properties cause load from both network transmission
                           costs between CellApp, BaseApp and DBMgr, as well as placing load onto
                           DBMgr when not using Secondary Databases. By minimising the number of
                           persistent properties as well as decreasing the size of properties that
                           are being persisted you will effect a long term performance gain in your
                           cluster.
                  </p>
                  <p>Determining the persistent properties can be performed by using
                           the WebConsole filtered watcher page using a Processes of 'cellapp' and
                           a Path of 'entityTypes/*/properties/*/persistent'. Once you have
                           narrowed down the persistent properties you can perform a review of them
                           to determine any optimisations that can be made.

                  <p>Often the easiest solution when developing a game is to set all
                           properties to <span class="literal">CELL_PUBLIC</span> or
                           <span class="literal">ALL_CLIENTS</span> as it provides the greatest visibility of
                           the property. This quite often works perfectly when developing in the
                           office on a single machine server that isn't heavily loaded, however
                           this can lead to large problems when performing load tests and scaling a
                           game up to production.

                           to use with properties is to use the object oriented design philosophy
                           of calling methods on an object, in this case an Entity, to request that
                           it perform work for you, rather than accessing its private information
                           yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>A common example is the health or HP of an entity. This value may
                           be constantly changing due to damage or regenerating health over time
                           and is often only directly relevant for the entity the property is
                           associated with. While other entities may be interested in this
                           property, they are only transiently interested, such as when they are
                           all in combat together, or if the entities have formed a group of
                           players. In this circumstance it may make sense to have the propagation
                           flag as <span class="literal">CELL_PRIVATE</span> which can be requested as
                           required by a method call. This reduces the amount of network traffic
                           generated from broadcasting the health property every time it is updated
                           but still allows access to the property when required.

                      particular bottlenecks in script that are causing issues with server
                      processes, such as long tick times resulting in process termination
                      through a SIGQUIT signal.

               <p>Profiling server side script is performed with the

                      run Python script, i.e., CellApp, BaseApp and DBMgr.
               </p>
               <p>This command will dump a table of the top cumulative and internal
                      times for script calls over a period of time. The user can optionally
                      display tables of callers and callees as well. See

               </div><pre class="programlisting">control_cluster.py eventprofile</pre><p>Recall that the server sends down both non-volatile data and
                      volatile data down to the client. Volatile data is in the form of position
                      and pose updates, while non-volatile data consists of the property updates
                      on an entity and client-side method calls for that entity, sent down to
                      any player that can witness that entity. The profiling of non-volatile
                      data can give valuable insight into which methods and property updates are
                      particularly high throughput, enabling effective optimisation of the
                      network impact of entity scripts.
               </p>
               <p>There is a distinction made between own-client communication and
                      other-client communication. Own-client communication consists of method
                      calls and property updates that only an entity's own client will receive.
                      These include updates for properties marked as
                      <span class="literal">OWN_CLIENT</span> as well as method calls that are made using
                      the <span class="literal">ownClient</span> mailbox, and are private to the player's
                      own entity and not broadcast to other players. Note that this type of
                      client communication only applies to player entities.
               </p>
               <p>In contrast, there is also other-client communication for an entity,
                      which consists of the public method calls and property updates that
                      players having that entity in their AoI are able to witness. This includes
                      updates for properties marked as <span class="literal">OTHER_CLIENTS</span> or
                      <span class="literal">ALL_CLIENTS</span>, as well as method calls made on an
                      entity''s <span class="literal">otherClients</span> or as well as the
                      <span class="literal">allClients</span> mailbox. These events are potentially
                      propagated to any player that has that entity in their AoI.
               </p>
               <p>Other-client events are not propagated to witnessing clients
                      immediately. For instance, the distance a player is from the entity an
                      event pertains to will affect how soon that event is propagated after the
                      event has actually occurred on the server side. In addition, the LoD level
                      set on properties and methods will affect whether a particular event will
                      be sent down to a witnessing player.
               </p>
               <p>Client communication is broken down into three types for the
                      purposes of profiling:
