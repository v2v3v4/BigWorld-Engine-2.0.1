            <p>We illustrate the previous chapters' guidelines with respect to handling
                 fault tolerance and disaster recovery mechanisms in BigWorld by providing an
                 example involving the use of transactions and how to make them work with fault
                 tolerance and disaster recovery mechanisms.

                        <p>Alice and Bob are within each other's Area of Interest (AoI).
                                   Alice's client informs her base entity that she would like to give Bob a
                                   Sword item.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alice's base entity is passed the player name of Bob as part of

                                   item within Alice's inventory.

                        <p>Alice's base entity adds an entry into her transaction list. This
                                   entry contains a unique transaction ID that identifies this transaction,
                                   Bob's player name, the state of the transaction (set to a symbolic
                                   constant called <span class="literal">BEGIN</span>), and the item in Alice's

                        <p>Alice's base entity removes the Sword from Alice's

                                   client informing Alice of this situation), and the Sword is added back
                                   to Alice's inventory.

                        <p>If Bob's base entity can't be found, the transaction is aborted by
                                   removing the transaction entry from the transaction list, adding the
                                   Sword back to Alice's inventory, informing Alice's client and calling

                                   mailbox and requesting that it add the Sword item to his inventory. We
                                   pass the item, transaction ID, Alice's player name and a mailbox back to

                        </p>
                        <p>Bob's base entity adds an entry into its transaction list, with

                                   passed in from Alice.
                        </p>
                        <p>Bob's base entity then starts a write to the database, registering
                                   a callback to a functor object that holds Alice's base entity mailbox
                                   and the transaction ID.

                                   transaction ID is stored in the functor callback).
                        </p>
                        <p>If the write was successful, the item should be marked as usable
                                   for Bob's client.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether or not the database write was successful, Bob's base
                                   entity informs Alice of the success of the database write through her
                                   base mailbox that is supplied through the functor callback. Bob passes
                                   in the success flag, a mailbox to Bob's base entity and the transaction
                                   ID.

                     <li>
                        <p>Alice's base entity receives the result of the transaction from
                                   Bob's side.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alice removes the transaction entry from her transaction

                        </p>
                        <p>If Bob indicated that the transaction was unsuccessful, Alice
                                   re-adds the item back to her inventory informs the client of the trading

                        </p>
                        <p>Alice writes to the database, and registers a callback to a
                                   functor that holds Bob's base mailbox and the transaction ID.
                        </p>
                        <p>Alice notifies Bob that the transaction on her side is complete,
                                   by passing in the transaction ID.

                  </div>
                  <p>If the CellApp that Alice's and/or Bob's cell entity resides on
                           exits, all cell entities that have base entities will be restored to
                           another CellApp. With this example scenario and transaction as described,
                           there is not much of concern with regards to behaviour of restored cell
                           entities as the transaction only involves BaseApps.
                  </p>
                  <p>However, suppose the inventory system implementation was such that
                           the player cell entities required knowledge of items, for example, what
                           item a player was holding in its hands, which would need to be a
                           <span class="literal">OTHER_CLIENTS</span> or <span class="literal">ALL_CLIENTS</span> cell
                           entity property so that other players could view the item that a player
                           was holding. If the cell entity was restored from an older version of its
                           cell entity data when it was last backed up to the base entity, there
                           could be inconsistencies in the cell entity state with respect to the base
                           entity state.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, if Alice was restored to another CellApp, her cell
                           entity could check with her base entity whether she still owned the item
                           that she was holding, and if not, her cell entity should remove that
                           item.
                  </p>
                  <p>Cell entities that are restored do not have their
                           <code class="methodname">__init__</code>() method called, instead, after they are
                           restored with the cell backup data from their base entity, they have their
                           <code class="methodname">onRestore</code>() method called, and checks such as
                           these can be done in this method to make sure the state is consistent with
                           the base entity state.

                  <p>If the BaseApp that Alice's and/or Bob's base entity resides on
                           exits, those base entities will be restored to other BaseApps if they
                           exist (if there is only one BaseApp, they cannot be restored).
                  </p>
                  <p>As with cell entities, restored base entities do not have
                           <code class="methodname">__init__</code>() called on them, instead, they have
                           <code class="methodname">onRestore</code>() called on them when they are each
                           restored from their most recent base entity backup data. This is a good
                           place to do checks on uncompleted transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, if the BaseApp that contained Alice exited, and Alice
                           was restored onto another BaseApp (and perhaps Bob was too, and it could
                           be a different BaseApp to where he was), then we need to replay any
                           transactions that may have been underway.
                  </p>
                  <p>For each transaction entry in Alice's transaction list, the entity
                           needs to replay each transaction depending on the state that it's
                           in.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, if it is in the <span class="literal">BEGIN</span> state, we
                           resume the transaction from step 3 by looking up Bob's base entity, and
                           continuing on.
                  </p>
                  <p>If we are Bob, we may have transactions in the
                           <span class="literal">REMOVE</span> state, and so we resume the transaction from
                           step 6, and we tell Alice (or whoever the transactions' player name refers
                           to) that they should complete the transaction on their end.

               <p>When we are starting the server and restoring from the database, the
                      base entities will be restored, and each of these will have
                      <code class="methodname">__init__</code>() called on them. The variable
                      <code class="classname">BigWorld</code>.<code class="varname">hasStarted</code> will be
                      <span class="literal">False</span> for restored base entities, so we can do similar
                      checks to what we have in the BaseApp fault tolerance section.
               </p>
               <p>It is also the responsibility of the base entities to recreate the
                      cell entities, usually via <code class="methodname">createCellEntity</code>(). The
                      space ID is archived with the entity when it is written to the database, and
                      this is present in the base entity's <code class="varname">cellData</code>
                      dictionary.
