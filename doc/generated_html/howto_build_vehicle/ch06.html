            <p>The Ripper is a simple single-passenger hover bike, designed to
                 demonstrate vehicle implementation. In this section, Ripper's implementation
                 is detailed to help in its use as a basis for new vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>The Ripper consists of the following files:</p>

               <p>The Ripper's cell manages control of the Ripper, and is responsible
                      for notifying all interested clients of such changes.
               </p>
               <p>When the Ripper is first created, the cell has control of its
                      movements, but passes this ability to clients as they attempt to use
                      it.

                                   for mounting the vehicle. In this method, control is transferred to
                                   the client, and the specified avatar's cell is requested to board the
                                   Ripper. The board request of the avatar forms stage 5 of 8 of the
                                   dismount process.

                                   back control of its movement, and requests that the avatar alight. The
                                   avatar's alight request forms stage 4 of 7 of the dismount

               <p>To work with vehicles, the Avatar entity must implement the client

               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul type="disc">

                        <p>In order to display correctly on clients observing other Avatars
                                   riding Rippers, the Avatar must notify its vehicle when it enters the
                                   world, as this will be after the vehicle enters it. In FantasyDemo,
                                   this is done using the function
                                   <code class="methodname">onPassengerEnterWorld()</code>.
                        </p>

                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>It must also implement the following cell methods:</p>

                        <p>Because the entity board and alight functions cannot be called
                                   on a ghost cell, they need to be wrapped in ghost-safe functions
                                   defined in the definition file.

                        <p>Similar to <code class="methodname">requestBoardVehicle()</code> this
                                   provides a ghost-safe wrapper for the entity alight vehicle
                                   functionality. It also does some checking, to make it safe to call
                                   multiple times before remounting.
