/**
 *  Helper class to decide when it's OK to ack a CellApp death back to the
 *  CellAppMgr.  We can't do this until:
 *
 *  - All the reals on this app have informed their bases of their addresses.
 *  - All emergencySetCurrentCell messages have been delivered and replied to.
 *
 *  We require both of these things so that all lost reals will be restored, and
 *  so that reals that weren't lost won't be restored.
 *
 *  This class polls for a finished state instead of using a nice callback-based
 *  design because there is no callback mechanism for detecting resolution of
 *  'critical' state on a Channel.  The reason that mechanism is not provided is
 *  that it is too much trouble to implement the streaming of those callbacks
 *  when Channels are offloaded.
 *
 *  TODO: Using requests/replies to check that emergencySetCurrentCell messages
 *  have been delivered is overkill.  Either use anonymous channels and mark
 *  them as critical, or implement a new Mercury mechanism for detecting the
 *  successful delivery of a Bundle (i.e. callback when all packets in a Bundle
 *  have been acked).
 *
 *  This object deletes itself.
