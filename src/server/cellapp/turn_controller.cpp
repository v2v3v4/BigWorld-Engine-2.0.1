/*~ function Entity addYawRotator
 *  @components{ cell }
 *  The addYawRotator function causes the Entity to turn towards a specified
 *  direction around the world's vertical axis. This is achieved by creating a
 *  new controller and adding it to the Entity. It throws a TypeError if the
 *  Entity is not real. The controller can be removed via the Entity's cancel
 *  function. For example, Entity.cancel( "Movement" ) or
 *	Entity.cancel( controllerID ).
 *  The controller will determine the shortest direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
 *  to turn
 *  On reaching its target yaw, the controller will call Entity.onTurn
 *  then delete itself. The Entity.onTurn method is not defined by default,
 *  and is called with two integer arguments, those being the ID of the
 *  controller, and the value specified as "userArg". Errors thrown by the
 *  attempt to call onTurn are silently ignored.
 *
 *	@see cancel
 *
 *  @param targetYaw targetYaw is a float representing the yaw to which the
 *  entity is to be turned, in radians and world space.
 *  @param velocity velocity is a float specifying the rate at which the entity
 *  should turn, in radians per second.
 *  @param userArg=0 userArg is an integer which is passed as the second
 *  parameter to onTurn.
 *
 *  @return The ID of the new controller. This can later be used with the
 *  Entity's cancel function to remove the controller and stop the Entity
 *  from turning. Entity.cancel( "Movement" ) can also be used to stop this
 *	controller.
