	 *	&lt;capsOff> fields (in the .model file definition of each action) for
	 *	each action, and the ActionMatcher will only match those actions for

	 *	other model so that they dont overlap.   Which model moves is
	 *	determined by the collisionRooted flag on the ActionMatcher on both
	 *	models.  If collisionRooted is set on either model, then that model
	 *	will NOT move away from the entity, leaving the onus for movement on
	 *	the other model.  If both have it set, then neither will move.  If it
	 *	is clear on both of them then they will both move half as far.  It
