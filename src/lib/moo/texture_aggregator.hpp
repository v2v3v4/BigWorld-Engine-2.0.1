/**
 *	Dynamically aggregates individual texture maps into a single big map. 
 *
 *	By using a TextureAggregator, smaller individual texture maps 
 *	(or just sections of them) may be tiled into a single bigger texture. 
 *	This is useful when compounding objects loaded separately to be drawn 
 *	with a single draw call or less texture swapping.
 *
 *	The aggregated texture will grow on demand to accommodate added tiles.
 *
 *	As textures get added to the aggregator, they will be tiled side by 
 *	side in the aggregated map. A tile ID is returned. Texture coordinates 
 *	of each tile in the aggregated map are accessible at any time given a 
 *	tile ID. Texture coordinates of tiles are always expressed in texels
 *	space.  A texture transform matrix is provided to translate from texels
 *	space the [0, 1] range. This prevents vertex buffers from needing to be 
 *	rebuilt when the aggregated map grows.
 *
 *	Tiles can also be removed from the aggregator. The texture will shrink
 *	when there is enough unused space in the aggregated map. During the 
 *	shrinking process, tiles will be reshuffled. When this happens, 
 *	previously returned texture coordinates will be stale and any vertex 
 *	buffer referring to them will have to be rebuilt. A callback informs 
 *	clients when this happens.
 *
 *	Currently, the TextureAggregator is limited to tiles of power of two size
 *	and, although supported, non-square tiles are stretched to be square and
 *	may present some visual artifacts.
