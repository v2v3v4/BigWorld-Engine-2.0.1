/**
 *
 *	Sample 1: ContentFactory declared by macro, perfect for CFormView and CWnd
 *	derived classes, not for CDialog derived classes:
 *	
 *	#include "guitabs/guitabs_content.hpp"
 *
 *	IMPLEMENT_BASIC_CONTENT_FACTORY( TestContent )
 *
 *	
 *	Sample 2: ContentFactory derived class:
 *
 *	#include "guitabs/guitabs_content.hpp"
 *	
 *	class TestFactory : public GUITABS::ContentFactory
 *	{
 *	public:
 *		GUITABS::ContentPtr create() { return new TestContent(); }
 *		std::string getContentID() { return TestContent::contentID; }  // see the sample for Content in content.hpp
 *	};
 *	
 *
 *  Sample 3: ContentFactory create method for classes that require special
 *	window creation like CDialog derived classes.
 *
 *	#include "guitabs/guitabs_content.hpp"
 *
 *	GUITABS::ContentPtr CDialogContentFactory::create()
 *	{
 *		CDialogContent* p = new CDialogContent(); // CDialogContent inherits from Content and CDialog
 *		p->Create( CDialogContent::IDD );  // the resource ID is asumed to be defined in a const inside CDialogContent in this example
 *		return p;
 *	};
 *	
 *	NOTE: Factory class declaration via macro must be done after the content
 *	class declaration, be it in the same file or in another file.
 *	NOTE: For CFormView and other classes is usually not necesary to create the
 *	window inside the factory's create method. If you don't create the window,
 *	GUITABS will try to create a default window for you. If you create the
 *	window, calling CWnd::Create or CWnd::CreateEx for example, GUITABS will
 *	use your created window. GUITABS only creates a window if the GetSafeHwnd() member
 *	is not a valid window handle ( it's tested using Win32's ::IsWindow() ).
 *
 *********************************************************
 *
 *  Sample 4: factory registration call in the cpp file that creates the panels, etc:
 *
 *	GUITABS::Manager::instance().registerFactory( new TestFactory() );
