	 *	This class is a basic adaptor between SimpleGUIComponent and PyAttachment.

	 *	If you wish to display pyAttachments in the GUI scene
	 *	then use this class as a container for your attachment, and attach the desired
	 *	object onto it.

	 *		eg,	guiSomeImage = GUI.Simple(imageFile)
	 *			guiSomeAttachment = BigWorld.Model(modelFile)
	 *			guiMesh = GUI.MeshAdaptor()
	 *			guiMesh.attachment = guiSomeAttachment
	 *			guiMesh.transform = someMatrixProvider
	 *			guiSomeImage.addChild(guiMesh)
	 *			GUI.addRoot(guiSomeImage)
	 *	@endcode
	 *	Model will now be displayed in GUI.  someMatrixProvider can be
	 *	updated to change the orientation of Model, and the model can
	 *	have animations performed on it like any other.
	 *
	 *	Note that this class draws during GUI time, meaning that the 
	 *	Z-Buffer is unavailable.  For this reason, it is only recommended
	 *	to use this class for displaying custom-built meshes, for example
	 *	custom shaped GUI borders or frames that are specifically made for
	 *	this purpose (are flat and/or draw using additive or alpha blending)
	 *
	 *	If you want to render your character in the user interface, then it
	 *	is more appropriate to use a PyModelRenderer or PySceneRenderer.
