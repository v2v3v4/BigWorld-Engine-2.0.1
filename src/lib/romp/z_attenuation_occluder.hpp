/**
 *	This class occlusion tests and draws a bunch of lens effects.
 *	It is provided as an alternative to using DirectX Occlusion Queries,
 *	as it is impossible to determine how many occlusion queries are
 *	available for any particular video card, and exceeding that
 *	number causes bad stalls to occur while we wait for the GPU to catch up.
 *
 *	The algorithm:
 *	1. For each lens effect visible on screen, add a 2x2 rectangle to our batch
 *	and assign it a location in the staging texture.
 *	2. Z-Read Disable : Draw the batch to the alpha channel of the main buffer,
 *	entirely black
 *	3. Z-Read Enable : Draw the batch to the alpha channel again, but in white.
 *	4. Copy the alpha results into the staging texture.
 *	5. Optional : Repeat step 2 to reset the main alpha channel to black.  This
 *	may be required for the following heat-shimmer pass.
 *	6. Draw all lens flares onto the screen, attenuating the corona texture map
 *	with the attenuation results from the staging texture.
 *
 *	There are 2 reasons to have a staging texture
 *	1. so lens flares can be drawn to the back buffer, if required
 *	2. so attenuation results can be accumulated over several frames, to fade in/
 *	fade out lens flares instead of just popping them in and out.
