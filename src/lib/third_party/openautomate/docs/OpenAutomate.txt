INTRODUCTION
    This directory contains the OpenAutomate SDK. It's intended for
    application developers who wish to instrument their applications so that
    NVIDIA can optimize the end-user experience for the application on
    NVIDIA hardware as efficiently as possible.

    The OpenAutomate SDK has been designed to be as unobtrusive and easy to
    integrate as possible for developers. All code that will be added to the
    application is provided as source code.

    For frequently asked questions, please see the Frequently Asked
    Questions (FAQ) document.

    Instrumenting an application with the OpenAutomate SDK allows NVIDIA to:

    * Enumeration of all application options as seen by the end-user when
    running on a given platform
    * Enumerate the current option settings
    * Set options persistently
    * Enumerate all available benchmarks
    * Run benchmarks

    All of the above features are necessary for NVIDIA to efficiently test
    the application within its testing labs. The ability to set options
    persistently is also necessary to deliver optimal application options to
    the end-user.

REQUIREMENTS
    To be OpenAutomate compatible, an application must have the following:

    * A command-line option '-openautomate' that takes a single opaque
    argument, to put the application into OpenAutomate mode
    * A method to enumerate all available options
    * Options directly visible (e.g. in the options menu of a GUI) to the
    end-user are clearly delineated (see "Option Namespaces")
    * A method to enumerate all current option settings
    * A method to set options persistently
    * A method to enumerate benchmarks
    * A method to run benchmarks
    * A method to run the application as normal
    * Exit with non-zero error codes if the application errors
    * The application must register itself within the system using the
    OpenAutomate standard during installation
    * The application must pass all OpenAutomate conformance tests (see
    oatest)

  IMPLEMENTATION
   Command-line option
    The instrumented application must add a command-line option
    -openautomate that accepts an opaque string as an option. It must have
    the form:

        app.exe -openautomate opaque_opt_str

    If this command-line is detected, the application must enter
    OpenAutomate mode by first calling oaInit(), passing it the option
    string.

  OpenAutomate Command Loop
    Immediately after oaInit() is called, the application must enter the
    OpenAutomate command loop, by calling oaGetNextCommand() repeatedly
    until OA_CMD_EXIT or OA_CMD_RUN is returned. Here's an example:

        while(1)
         {
          oaInitCommand(&Command);
          switch(oaGetNextCommand(&Command))
           {
            /* No more commands, exit program */
            case OA_CMD_EXIT: 
             return;

            /* Run as normal */
            case OA_CMD_RUN: 
             RunApp();
             return;

            /* Enumerate all in-game options */
            case OA_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS: 
             GetAllOptions();
             break;

            /* Return the option values currently set */
            case OA_CMD_GET_CURRENT_OPTIONS:
             GetCurrentOptions();
             break;

            /* Set all in-game options */
            case OA_CMD_SET_OPTIONS: 
             SetOptions();
             break;

            /* Enumerate all known benchmarks */
            case OA_CMD_GET_BENCHMARKS: 
             GetBenchmarks();
             break;

            /* Run a benchmark */
            case OA_CMD_RUN_BENCHMARK: 
             RunBenchmark(Command.BenchmarkName);
             break;
           }
         }

  OpenAutomate Commands
    Each of the seven commands must be supported by the application.

   OA_CMD_EXIT
    The application should cleanup and exit as soon as possible.

   OA_CMD_RUN
    This command instructs the application to run as normal; it should run
    as if OpenAutomate mode was never invoked. However, when the user
    chooses to exit the application, the application must not exit the
    process. Instead, it should cleanup and return back to the command loop,
    calling oaGetNextCommand().

   OA_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS
    The application must enumerate all options available to the end user.
    For each available option, oaAddOption() must be called. For options of
    type OA_TYPE_ENUM options oaAddOption() must be called for each possible
    enumerant value. See "Enumerating Options" for more information.

   OA_CMD_GET_CURRENT_OPTIONS
    The application should call oaAddOptionValue() for each available
    option, to enumerate what each option is currently set to.

   OA_CMD_SET_OPTIONS
    The application should call oaGetNextOption() repeatedly, until it
    returns NULL. The application should persistently (between invocations
    of the application) set the option value to the value indicated by the
    oaNamedOption struct pointer returned:

        while((Option = oaGetNextOption()) != NULL)
         {
          /*
           * Set option value to persist for subsequent runs of the game 
           * to the given value.  Option->Name will be the name of the value, 
           * and Option->Value will contain the appropriate value.
           */
         }

   OA_CMD_GET_BENCHMARKS
    The application should enumerate all known benchmarks. Benchmark is
    loosely defined as any available automated test.

    Each benchmark must have a unique string identifier. oaAddBenchmark()
    must be called for each known benchmark.

   OA_CMD_RUN_BENCHMARK
    The application should run the benchmark named by the BenchmarkName
    field returned in the struct by oaGetNextCommand(). There are three
    callback functions that should be called by the application:

    * void oaStartBenchmark(void)
        The application should call oaStartBenchmark() right before the
        benchmark starts. It should be called before any CPU or GPU
        computation is done for the first frame.

    * void oaDisplayFrame(oaInt frame)
        This should be called right before the final present call is called
        for each frame.

        Applications that aren't real-time are not required to call this
        callback. They can simple call oaStartBenchMark() and
        oaEndBenchMark() without calling oaDisplayFrame() in between.

    * void oaEndBenchmark(void)
        This should be called after the last frame is rendered in the
        benchmark.

    In addition to the callbacks, oaAddResultValue() or oaAddFrameValue()
    may optionally be called in order to return benchmark scores, or any
    test results. oaAddResultValue() must be called after the last call to
    oaDisplayFrame() (on the last frame), and before oaEndBenchmark().
    oaAddFrameValue() must be called each frame, right before
    oaDisplayFrame() is called.

  Enumerating Options
    The OpenAutomate SDK supports options of different data types:

    * OA_TYPE_STRING
        String values

    * OA_TYPE_INT
        Integer values

    * OA_TYPE_FLOAT
        Floating-point values

    * OA_TYPE_ENUM
        Enumerant values

    * OA_TYPE_BOOL
        Boolean values

    For all data types except OA_TYPE_ENUM, oaAddOption() is called once per
    option.

    oaAddOption() takes a pointer to a oaNamedOption struct as input. The
    struct must first be initialized with the oaInitOption() function. Every
    option must have the following fields initialized:

    * DataType
        The data type (e.g. OA_TYPE_INT) of the option

    * Name
        A string containing the exact name of the parameter as seen by the
        end-user of the application

   oaAddOption() with OA_TYPE_ENUM
    For options of type OA_TYPE_ENUM, oaAddOption() is called once per
    possible enumerant value of that option. The field Value.Enum must be
    set to each possible enumerant value.

    For example, an option named Resolution with values 640x480, 1024x768,
    and 1600x1200 would be defined with the following code:

        {
         oaNamedOptionStruct Option; 

         oaInitOption(&Option);
         Option.Name = "Resolution";
         Option.DataType = OA_TYPE_ENUM;

         Option.Value.Enum = "640x480";
         oaAddOption(&Option);

         Option.Value.Enum = "1024x768";
         oaAddOption(&Option);

         Option.Value.Enum = "1600x1200";
         oaAddOption(&Option);
        }

    If possible, all enumerant values should be sorted such that the first
    enumerant value produces the lowest quality and the last enumerant value
    produces the highest quality. Quality is obviously subjective, but in
    the case of an option such as Resolution, the order is obvious.

   Numeric Types
    Options with numeric data types OA_TYPE_INT and OA_TYPE_FLOAT are
    assumed to have open and continues ranges for possible values by
    default. Options can be limited to ranges optional steps by setting the
    NumSteps, MinValue, and MaxValue fields. NumSteps can be set to:

    * NumSteps = -1
        If the range is open

    * NumSteps = 0
        If it's closed, but continuous within the range

    * NumSteps > 0
        If the range is divided up into NumSteps number of points

    MinValue.Int and MaxValue.Int, or MinValue.Float and MaxValue.Float must
    be set to the appropriate range values for options of OA_TYPE_INT and
    OA_TYPE_FLOAT respectively.

    For example, a floating point parameter named Quality ranging from 1.0
    to 5.0 with increments of 0.25 (e.g. 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, ...
    4.75, 5.0) can be defined with the following code:

        {
         oaNamedOptionStruct Option; 

         oaInitOption(&Option);
         Option.Name = "Quality";
         Option.DataType = OA_TYPE_FLOAT;

         Option.NumSteps = 16;
         Option.MinValue.Float = 1.0;
         Option.MaxValue.Float = 5.0;
         oaAddOption(&Option);
        }

   Option Namespaces
    Options may be grouped into hierarchical namespaces by using the
    reserved separator / within the option name, similar to standard
    filesystem path naming conventions.

    If hierarchical namespaces are not used, all available options are
    assumed to be visible to the end-user, if they were to run the
    application outside of OpenAutomate mode.

    If hierarchical namespaces are used, care must be taken to delineate
    between options that are exposed directly to the end-user, and ones that
    are not. Options under the top-level namespace User/ are assumed to be
    directly visible to the end-user. All other options are assumed to not
    be directly visible.

    The special character / can be used within the name of an option by
    escaping it with an additional //. For example, User/In//Out would
    represent the option named In/Out in the top-level namespace User.

   Option Dependencies
    Often, applications have options that are enabled only when some other
    parent option's value meets a certain condition. The OpenAutomate SDK
    supports such dependencies, if the condition can be expressed with the
    form:

        ParentVal EXP Constant

    Where ParentVal is the value of the parent option, Constant is some
    constant value of the same type as ParentVal, and EXP is one of:

    * OA_COMP_OP_EQUAL
        Equality (e.g. ==)

    * OA_COMP_OP_NOT_EQUAL
        Inequality (e.g. !=)

    * OA_COMP_OP_GREATER
        Greater than (e.g. >)

    * OA_COMP_OP_LESS
        Less than (e.g. <)

    * OA_COMP_OP_GREATER_OR_EQUAL
        Greater than or equal to (e.g. >=)

    * OA_COMP_OP_LESS_OR_EQUAL
        Less than or equal to (e.g. <=)

    If a dependency exists, it can be setup by setting the subfields
    Dependency.ParentName, Dependency.ComparisonVal, and
    Dependency.ComparisonOp. For example, if an option named Volume is
    dependent on a boolean parent option named Sound Enabled equaling OA_ON
    for it to be enabled:

        {
         oaNamedOptionStruct Option; 

         oaInitOption(&Option);
         Option.Name = "Volume";
         Option.DataType = OA_TYPE_FLOAT;

         Option.Dependency.ParentName = "Sound Enabled";
         Option.Dependency.ComparisonOp = OA_COMP_OP_EQUAL;
         Option.Dependency.ComparisonVal.Bool = OA_ON;

         Option.MinValue.Float = 0;
         Option.MaxValue.Float = 10;
         Option.NumSteps = 0;

         oaAddOption(&Option);
        }

  Signals
    The application may send various signals at various points throughout
    its run via the oaSendSignal() function:

        oaBool oaSendSignal(oaSignalType signal, void *param);

    Some signals may require a parameter param. For those that don't, a NULL
    should be passed in. The available signals are:

    OA_SIGNAL_SYSTEM_REBOOT
        Some benchmarks and tests require a reboot mid-run. This signal
        requests a safe reboot. After the call to oaSendSignal() completes,
        the application must:

        1. cleanup and save the benchmark state
        2. exit the process gracefully
        3. upon the next invocation of the appliation with identical
        command-line params, continue running benchmark from where it left
        off when the signal was sent
            param must be passed in as NULL.

    OA_SIGNAL_ERROR
        This signal raises an error exception. param must point to a valid
        oaMessage. The Error field of the oaMessage object should be set to
        the appropriate oaErrorType value, and the Message field either be
        NULL or point to an error message. oaInitMessage must be called on
        the oaMessage object before settings these values.

        This signal may be used for warnings (non-fatal errors), and log
        messages by setting the Error field of the oaMessage object to
        OA_ERROR_WARNING and OA_ERROR_LOG respectively.

        The following convenience macros are provided for raising errors,
        warnings, and log messages:

            OA_RAISE_ERROR(error_type, message_str) 
            OA_RAISE_WARNING(message_str) 
            OA_RAISE_LOG(message_str) 

  Building with the SDK
    Building your application with the SDK is intentionally simple. It
    requires only three files from the SDK to be included in your project:

       inc/OpenAutomate.h
       inc/OpenAutomate_Internal.h
       src/OpenAutomate.c

    inc/OpenAutomate.h is the only include file your application needs to
    include.

  Example Application
    See examples/simple_app/simple_app.cpp for an example dummy application
    instrumented with the OpenAutomate SDK. To build the application, along
    with a simple plug-in (simple_plugin.dll) to run with the simple
    application, simply load the included Visual Studio solution
    OpenAutomate.sln and build all. The resulting binaries will be in the
    debug sub-directory--release if you choose the release target--in the
    root of the SDK. Once built, you can run the simple application with the
    command-line:

        .\exe\simple_app.exe -openautomate plugins\simple_plugin.dll

    simple_plugin.dll will run simple_app through various commands, and
    write out the result to stderr. The output should look something like:

        simple_app: Reading options file ".simple_app_options.txt".
        IN AddOption: 'User/Resolution'
        IN AddOption: 'User/Resolution'

        Result value (int)'Score' = 18249
        Result value (float)'Some other score' = 29.140000
        Benchmark ended
          Total time = 1s
          Avg. FPS = 50.000000

  Registering an Application with OpenAutomate
    Applications that have OpenAutomate integrated--and are thus
    "OpenAutomate Enabled"--must register themselves when they're installed
    on the system, so that applications interested in invoking OpenAutomate
    Enabled applications may easily find them on the system, without doing a
    filesystem scan.

    Application registration is a simple matter of creating a file with
    name/value pairs, or creating some registry keys (Windows only).

    Applications searching for installed OpenAutomate Enabled applications
    will search various roots, building a list of available applications.
    There is precedence in the search order, so that if the same application
    definition file or registry entry exists under more than one root, the
    location with higher priority overrides the other.

    The locations searched from higher to lower precedence are:

    * Filesystem:
    <ENV{OPENAUTOMATE_DIR}<gt>/OpenAutomate/RegisteredApps/<DEV_NAME>/<APP_N
    AME>/<APP_BUILD_NAME>
    * Filesystem:
    <HOME>/OpenAutomate/RegisteredApps/<DEV_NAME>/<APP_NAME>/<APP_BUILD_NAME
    >
    * Filesystem:
    <SYSTEM_ROOT>/OpenAutomate/RegisteredApps/<DEV_NAME>/<APP_NAME>/<APP_BUI
    LD_NAME>
    * Registry:
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\OpenAutomate\RegisteredApps\<DEV_NAME>\<APP_N
    AME>\<APP_BUILD_NAME>
    * Registry:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\OpenAutomate\RegisteredApps\<DEV_NAME>\<APP_
    NAME>\<APP_BUILD_NAME>

    Where:

    * <HOME>
        The home directory of the current user.

    * <SYSTEM_ROOT>
        The root directory of the system.

    * <DEV_NAME>
        The name of the developer of the application (e.g. NVIDIA).

    * <APP_NAME>
        The name of the application (e.g. simple_app).

    * <APP_BUILD_NAME>
        The name of the specific build (e.g. v1.1, 080511, ...).

    For registration via the filesystem, a file (format detailed below) must
    be created with the given path (e.g.
    <HOME>/.openautomate/<DEV_NAME>/<APP_NAME>/<APP_BUILD_NAME>). The
    name/value pairs will be stored within this file.

    For registration via the Windows registry, a key with the given path
    must be created, and the name/value pairs are stored as values under
    this key.

    The following name/value pairs must be defined:

    * INSTALL_ROOT_PATH
        The full path to the installation directory for the application.

    * ENTRY_EXE
        Full path to the executable that can be called with the
        -openautomate option to start the application in OpenAutomate mode.

    * INSTALL_DATETIME
        The date and time the application was installed in ISO8601 format.

    * REGION
        A list of regions/languages supported by the build in RFC3066
        format. If multiple regions/languages are supported, they can be
        listed by separating them with the | character.

   Unicode & Strings
    All of the OpenAutomate functions that receive or return strings are
    assumed to be UTF-8 encoded strings. This simplifies plug-in
    development, while still supporting all languages. Furthermore, it
    maintains compatibility with standard ASCII strings without any extra
    effort.

   Utility Functions for Registering/Unregistering the Application
    Utility functions to register and unregister the application are
    provided with the SDK. User's of OpenAutomate are free to use the
    functions directly, or as example. Please see *OpenAutomateUtil.h* and
    *OpenAutomateUtil.c* for more information.

   Uninstallation
    Upon uninstallation of the application, any registration files or
    registry settings registering the application must be deleted.

   Registration File Format
    * The file is encoded in UTF-8 to support extended characters.
    * The first 5 bytes of the file must be the magic value 'OAREG '.
    * Following the magic is the version number of the file format, followed
    by a newline.
    * Lines containing only whitespace are ignored.
    * Non-whitespace only lines must have name/value pairs.
        The format is: <NAME> : <VALUE>

        Whitespace preceding and following the <NAME> and <VALUE> tokens are
        ignored.

    Here's an example registration file:

        OAREG 1.0 

        INSTALL_ROOT_PATH: c:\Program Files\My Company\My Game
        ENTRY_EXE:         c:\Program Files\My Company\My Game\Bin\mygame.exe -i -o
        INSTALL_DATETIME:  2008-05-31 15:01:02
        REGION:            en_US|ko_KR

  Integrating OpenAutomate into an application
    The OpenAutomate SDK can be integrated to a game application in a number
    of ways and it is up to the game developers to decide which way to use.
    Examples are:

    * Include OpenAutomate.c to some project and add "#include
    SDKPATH/OpenAutomate.h" to all c/c++ files that use OpenAutomate calls
    * include OpenAutomate project to a game solution file and link the
    final exe against OpenAutomate library

   Integration by including OpenAutomate sources/headers to game project file
    This is the simplest and the preferable OpenAutomate integration method.
    There is no overhead of separate project, no project settings headache
    and game developer will never have any link problems related to
    OpenAutomate. The recommended integration sequence is following:

    * unzip the whole OpenAutomate SDK to some directory, for example
    \ThirdParty\OpenAutomate. Upgrade to next OpenAautomate version will
    require a single directory replacement. There may be several
    OpenAutomate versions in 'ThirdParty' directory, put the latest to
    directory named like 'OpenAutomate' (without version name), it will
    eliminate any project changes on OpenAutomate upgrades.
    * all c/c++ files that use OpenAutomate should include
    <OpenAutomate\OpenAutomate.h> header (supposedly OA is located somewhere
    like ThirdParty/OpenAutomate and ThirdParty is in the project include
    paths).
    * put OpenAutomate.c to the application project (or some library
    project). It should be included only once.
    * Add the code that work with OpenAutomate to you game application

    If there are warnings or compilations errors please report them to your
    DevTech support engineer.
