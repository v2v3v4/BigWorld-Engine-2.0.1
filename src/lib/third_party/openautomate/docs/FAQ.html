<H2><A NAME="WHAT_IS_OPENAUTOMATE?"><A NAME="2">What is OpenAutomate? 

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate (OA) is a standard API for automating the testing and benchmarking 
of applications.  Applications that provide an OpenAutomate interface, can 
be controlled by any testing harness that is OpenAutomate compatible, without
the harness knowing any specifics about the application a priori.


</P>
<P>
The application exposes the following functionality via the OpenAutomate 
interface: 


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
enumerating all available application options

</LI>
<LI>
querying current application option values

</LI>
<LI>
setting current application option values persistently

</LI>
<LI>
enumerating all available benchmarks (tests)

</LI>
<LI>
running benchmarks (tests) and getting resulting information

</LI>
<LI>
running an application as normal

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These basic functions provide everything necessary to generically test almost
any application.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHO_CAN_USE_OPENAUTOMATE?"><A NAME="3">Who can use OpenAutomate?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate can be useful for anybody interested in testing applications in
an efficient and automated fashion.  These may include but are not limited to:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
application developers

</LI>
<LI>
application publishers

</LI>
<LI>
independent hardware vendors (IHVs)

</LI>
<LI>
application reviewers

</LI>
<LI>
etc...

</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="I'M_AN_APPLICATION_DEVELOPER/PUBLISHER,_WHAT_CAN_OPENAUTOMATE_DO_FOR_ME?"><A NAME="4">I'm an application developer/publisher, what can OpenAutomate do for me?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
For application developers/publishers, adding OpenAutomate to your application 
allows the application to be used with any OpenAutomate compatible tools 
(e.g. oaMan).
It also allows others (e.g. IHVs) to test your applications within their 
internal testing infrastructure with minimal custom development to integrate
your application into their process.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="I'M_AN_APPLICATION_USER,_WHAT_CAN_OPENAUTOMATE_DO_FOR_ME?"><A NAME="5">I'm an application user, what can OpenAutomate do for me?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate allows manipulation of application settings, and running 
benchmarks/tests for all OpenAutomate-enabled applications in a standardized,
and centralized way.  


</P>
<P>
For example, a user running oaMan with their OpenAutomate compatible 
applications can:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
create a list of benchmarks from different OA-enabled applications, each with specific settings

</LI>
<LI>
run these benchmarks in batch mode, and collect all the results in unified manner

</LI>
<LI>
save the benchmark list, and rerun it with oaMan on another machine with the same settings

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The ability to query and manipulate application settings combined with the the 
ability to run benchmarks/tests allows for a multitude of very interesting tools
that can benefit users.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHERE_CAN_I_GET_OPENAUTOMATE?"><A NAME="6">Where can I get OpenAutomate?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
You can find the latest release of the OpenAutomate SDK and related tools 
at:  <A HREF="http://openautomate.com">openautomate.com</A> 


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHOM_SHOULD_I_CONTACT_IF_I_HAVE_PROBLEMS_WITH_OPENAUTOMATE?"><A NAME="7">Whom should I contact if I have problems with OpenAutomate?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Questions related to OpenAutomate should be directed by email to
OpenAutomate-Support@nvidia.com.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="HOW_IS_OPENAUTOMATE_LICENSED?"><A NAME="8">How is OpenAutomate licensed?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
The OpenAutomate SDK is made freely available for integration into any 
application.  To the best of our knowledge, it is compatible with both commercial 
and open source licenses.


</P>
<P>
Please refer to the ''LICENSE'' file included in the root directory of the SDK 
for more information.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHY_IS_OPENAUTOMATE_CALLED_OPEN?"><A NAME="9">Why is OpenAutomate called Open?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate is open, because it is free--both as in speech and as in beer--
for anyone to integrate into their applications, tools, and testing 
infrastructure.  The OpenAutomate SDK is provided in source form, and can be 
inspected and modified by anyone who is interested in doing so.  


</P>
<P>
The only restriction is with the OpenAutomate name.  Currently it is trademarked
by NVIDIA.  Any branches of the OpenAutomate SDK that are made public must either
be approved by NVIDIA, or renamed to something other than <B>OpenAutomate</B>.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="IS_IT_DIFFICULT_TO_INTEGRATE_OPENAUTOMATE_INTO_MY_APPLICATION?"><A NAME="10">Is it difficult to integrate OpenAutomate into my application?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
We've found that almost all developers can integrate OpenAutomate into their 
applications in less than a day, as long as they know their way around the 
options and benchmarking/testing functionality in their applications well 
enough.  


</P>
<P>
The single hardest part of integrating OpenAutomate is not related to the
OpenAutomate SDK; it's ensuring there is good benchmark/testing scaffolding as
well as good benchmarks/tests within your application.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="CAN_OPENAUTOMATE_ADD_BENCHMARKS_TO_MY_APPLICATION_FOR_ME?"><A NAME="11">Can OpenAutomate add benchmarks to my application for me?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate is a very thin interface for querying and modify settings, as well
as running benchmarks/tests.  It can only expose existing benchmarks/tests within
your application.  It is not some magic way of adding useful tests to an existing
application.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHAT_IF_MY_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TO_RESTART_AFTER_SETTINGS_HAVE_BEEN_CHANGED?"><A NAME="12">What if my application needs to restart after settings have been changed?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
The OpenAutomate standard does not require that the entry executable for 
OpenAutomate to be the same as the main executable for your application.  If 
your application needs to restart the application when settings are changed; 
it's best to create a porxy executable that exposes the OpenAutomate interface,
can manipulate and query applications options, and starts and stops the main
application executable when the <B>OA_CMD_RUN_BENCHMARK</B> command is issued.


</P>
<P>
See <A TARGET="_top" HREF="OpenAutomate.html#OPENAUTOMATE_PROXY_EXECUTABLES">the <I>"OpenAutomate Proxy Executables"</I> section of the <I>"OpenAutomate"</I> document</A> for more information.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="IS_OPENAUTOMATE_ONLY_FOR_GAMES?"><A NAME="13">Is OpenAutomate only for games?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Although adoption of OpenAutomate has primarily been within the game community,
there is nothing specific about OpenAutomate that restricts it to games.  
OpenAutomate can just as easily be used with any type of application.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHAT_IS_THE_OPENAUTOMATE_CONFORMANCE_TEST_SUITE_(OATEST)?"><A NAME="14">What is the OpenAutomate conformance test suite (oatest)?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
The OpenAutomate conformance test suite (oatest) is collection of various tests
included with the OpenAutomate SDK, used to ensure that an application has 
OpenAutomate implemented correctly.  Applications must pass oatest without any
test failures in order to be "OpenAutomate compatible".


</P>
<P>
Please see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="oatest.html">the <I>"oatest"</I> document</A> for more information.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="WHAT_OPERATING_SYSTEMS_DOES_OPENAUTOMATE_SUPPORT?"><A NAME="15">What operating systems does OpenAutomate support?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate is currently compatible with any Win32, and Win64 operating 
systems (e.g.  WinXP, Vista, Windows 7, ...) as well as POSIX compliant
platforms (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, ...).  However, OpenAutomate has currently only 
been extensively tested and used on Windows platforms.  


</P>

<H2><A NAME="IS_OPENAUTOMATE_RESTRICTED_TO_USAGE_WITH_ANY_PARTICULAR_GRAPHICS_APIS_(DIRECTX,_OPENGL,_ETC...)"><A NAME="16">Is OpenAutomate restricted to usage with any particular graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, etc...)

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate can be used with any type of application (see 
<A HREF="#IS_OPENAUTOMATE_ONLY_FOR_GAMES?">the <I>"Is OpenAutomate only for games?"</I> section within this document</A>), and is not related to graphical 
applications and hence any graphics APIs.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="IS_OPENAUTOMATE_RESTRICTED_TO_ANY_PARTICULAR_HARDWARE?"><A NAME="17">Is OpenAutomate restricted to any particular hardware?

</A></A></H2>
<P>
OpenAutomate is hardware agnostic.  As long as a particular hardware can run 
on one of the supported operating systems 
(see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="What operating systems does OpenAutomate support?.html">the <I>"What operating systems does OpenAutomate support?"</I> document</A>), the hardware can 
support OpenAutomate.
