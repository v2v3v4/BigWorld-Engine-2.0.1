OpenAutomate Frequently Asked Questions
  What is OpenAutomate?
    OpenAutomate (OA) is a standard API for automating the testing and
    benchmarking of applications. Applications that provide an OpenAutomate
    interface, can be controlled by any testing harness that is OpenAutomate
    compatible, without the harness knowing any specifics about the
    application a priori.

    The application exposes the following functionality via the OpenAutomate
    interface:

    * enumerating all available application options
    * querying current application option values
    * setting current application option values persistently
    * enumerating all available benchmarks (tests)
    * running benchmarks (tests) and getting resulting information
    * running an application as normal

    These basic functions provide everything necessary to generically test
    almost any application.

  Who can use OpenAutomate?
    OpenAutomate can be useful for anybody interested in testing
    applications in an efficient and automated fashion. These may include
    but are not limited to:

    * application developers
    * application publishers
    * independent hardware vendors (IHVs)
    * application reviewers
    * etc...

  I'm an application developer/publisher, what can OpenAutomate do for me?
    For application developers/publishers, adding OpenAutomate to your
    application allows the application to be used with any OpenAutomate
    compatible tools (e.g. oaMan). It also allows others (e.g. IHVs) to test
    your applications within their internal testing infrastructure with
    minimal custom development to integrate your application into their
    process.

  I'm an application user, what can OpenAutomate do for me?
    OpenAutomate allows manipulation of application settings, and running
    benchmarks/tests for all OpenAutomate-enabled applications in a
    standardized, and centralized way.

    For example, a user running oaMan with their OpenAutomate compatible
    applications can:

    * create a list of benchmarks from different OA-enabled applications,
    each with specific settings
    * run these benchmarks in batch mode, and collect all the results in
    unified manner
    * save the benchmark list, and rerun it with oaMan on another machine
    with the same settings

    The ability to query and manipulate application settings combined with
    the the ability to run benchmarks/tests allows for a multitude of very
    interesting tools that can benefit users.

  Where can I get OpenAutomate?
    You can find the latest release of the OpenAutomate SDK and related
    tools at: http://openautomate.com

  Whom should I contact if I have problems with OpenAutomate?
    Questions related to OpenAutomate should be directed by email to
    OpenAutomate-Support@nvidia.com.

  How is OpenAutomate licensed?
    The OpenAutomate SDK is made freely available for integration into any
    application. To the best of our knowledge, it is compatible with both
    commercial and open source licenses.

    Please refer to the ''LICENSE'' file included in the root directory of
    the SDK for more information.

  Why is OpenAutomate called Open?
    OpenAutomate is open, because it is free--both as in speech and as in
    beer-- for anyone to integrate into their applications, tools, and
    testing infrastructure. The OpenAutomate SDK is provided in source form,
    and can be inspected and modified by anyone who is interested in doing
    so.

    The only restriction is with the OpenAutomate name. Currently it is
    trademarked by NVIDIA. Any branches of the OpenAutomate SDK that are
    made public must either be approved by NVIDIA, or renamed to something
    other than OpenAutomate.

  Is it difficult to integrate OpenAutomate into my application?
    We've found that almost all developers can integrate OpenAutomate into
    their applications in less than a day, as long as they know their way
    around the options and benchmarking/testing functionality in their
    applications well enough.

    The single hardest part of integrating OpenAutomate is not related to
    the OpenAutomate SDK; it's ensuring there is good benchmark/testing
    scaffolding as well as good benchmarks/tests within your application.

  Can OpenAutomate add benchmarks to my application for me?
    OpenAutomate is a very thin interface for querying and modify settings,
    as well as running benchmarks/tests. It can only expose existing
    benchmarks/tests within your application. It is not some magic way of
    adding useful tests to an existing application.

  What if my application needs to restart after settings have been changed?
    The OpenAutomate standard does not require that the entry executable for
    OpenAutomate to be the same as the main executable for your application.
    If your application needs to restart the application when settings are
    changed; it's best to create a porxy executable that exposes the
    OpenAutomate interface, can manipulate and query applications options,
    and starts and stops the main application executable when the
    OA_CMD_RUN_BENCHMARK command is issued.

    See "OpenAutomate Proxy Executables" in OpenAutomate for more
    information.

  Is OpenAutomate only for games?
    Although adoption of OpenAutomate has primarily been within the game
    community, there is nothing specific about OpenAutomate that restricts
    it to games. OpenAutomate can just as easily be used with any type of
    application.

  What is the OpenAutomate conformance test suite (oatest)?
    The OpenAutomate conformance test suite (oatest) is collection of
    various tests included with the OpenAutomate SDK, used to ensure that an
    application has OpenAutomate implemented correctly. Applications must
    pass oatest without any test failures in order to be "OpenAutomate
    compatible".

    Please see oatest for more information.

  What operating systems does OpenAutomate support?
    OpenAutomate is currently compatible with any Win32, and Win64 operating
    systems (e.g. WinXP, Vista, Windows 7, ...) as well as POSIX compliant
    platforms (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, ...). However, OpenAutomate has currently
    only been extensively tested and used on Windows platforms.

  Is OpenAutomate restricted to usage with any particular graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, etc...)
    OpenAutomate can be used with any type of application (see "Is
    OpenAutomate only for games?"), and is not related to graphical
    applications and hence any graphics APIs.

  Is OpenAutomate restricted to any particular hardware?
    OpenAutomate is hardware agnostic. As long as a particular hardware can
    run on one of the supported operating systems (see "What operating
    systems does OpenAutomate support?"), the hardware can support
    OpenAutomate.
