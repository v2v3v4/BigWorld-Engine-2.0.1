v0.6 - July 19, 2008
    This release helps maintain backward compatibility in future releases by
    adding the byte size of structs passed to functions in the API to the
    structs themselves. Unfortunately, this addition breaks backward
    compatibility with previous versions of the OpenAutomate SDK.

    * Conformance test suite has been added
        The SDK now includes the OpenAutomate conformance test suite named
        oatest in source form. Applications that claim to be OpenAutomate
        compatible must pass the tests within this suite. Please see oatest
        for more information.

    * structs now have StructSize field
        oaMessage, oaNamedOption, oaOptionDependency, and oaCommand now have
        a field oaInt StructSize as their first field. This is initialized
        to the sizeof() of their respective types in order to allow either
        backward compatibility in future versions of the SDK or graceful
        failure.

        The StructSize field must be initialized by the associated
        oaInitXXX() functions:

            /* Initializes an oaMessage */
            void oaInitMessage(oaMessage *message);

            /* Initializes an oaCommand */
            void oaInitCommand(oaCommand *command);

            /* Initializes an oaNamedOption, and the member oaOptionDependency */
            void oaInitOption(oaNamedOption *option);

    * oaInitCommand() added
        oaInitCommand() was added to the API. It must be called on the
        oaCommand object sent to oaGetNextCommand() before each call to
        oaGetNextCommand().

    * ComparisonValType member added to oaOptionDependency struct
        Until this release, plug-ins had to infer the type of
        oaOptionDependency.ComparisonVal by maintaining a mapping of option
        names to option type from previous calls to oaAddOption. This had
        two unfortunate side-effects:

        * The application was required to always call oaAddOption() for the
        parent option first.
        * Plug-ins had to maintain global state for the mapping, needlessly
        complicating plug-in development.

        The addition of ComparisonValType removes these restrictions. The
        application must now set this value to the type of the parent
        option. It must match the type of the parent option, when
        oaAddOption is called with it.

    * added oaiInitFuncTable() in OpenAutomate_Internal.h
        This function should be used to initialize an oaiFunctionTable
        instead of explicitly calling memset() and setting the TableSize
        field.

        Note: This function is only used when developing OA plug-ins.

    * Switched to const oaChar * from oaString
        Many locations where oaString were used have now been switched to
        const oaChar * to force compile time restrictions in cases where the
        string should not be modified.

v0.5 - June 17, 2008
    Fifth alpha release. This is mostly "service pack" release intended to
    ease OA integration

    * absolute paths were replaced with relative "../inc/file.h"-style paths
        It eliminates the need to change project options or change
        OpenAutomate sources

    * Default level compile warnings were eiminated
        OpenAutomate should compile without warnings when default warning
        level is used.

    * OpenAutomateUtil moved to examples
        It was decided OpenAutomateUtil is not essential part of the core
        OpenAutomate and may be separated from the core OpenAutomate logic.

    * simple_app.cpp was corrected and extended
        simple_app.cpp now enumerates options using namespaces new options
        added to provide more relevant examples of options usage

    * minor OpenAutomate core changes
          OpenAutomate.h:
            - OA_PLATFORM (old PLATFORM may cause collisions) is "autodetected"
          OpenAutomate.cpp: 
            - init string parsing modifications
            - Unicode fix (LoadLibraryA is replaced with LoadLibraryW)
            - minor bugfixes

v0.4 - May 16, 2008
    Fourth alpha release.

    * all strings are assumed to be UTF-8
        From the docs:

           All of the OpenAutomate functions that receive or return strings are assumed
           to be UTF-8 encoded strings.  This simplifies plug-in development, while still
           supporting all languages.  Furthermore, it maintains compatibility with 
           standard ASCII strings without any extra effort.

    * added oaAddFrameValue() function
        This function may be used for providing per frame statistics and
        results during benchmark runs. It works similarly to
        oaAddResultValue() but is called every frame, before
        oaDisplayFrame() is called.

    * more clearly defined OA_CMD_RUN
        From the docs:

            This command instructs the application to run as normal; it should run as if
            OpenAutomate mode was never invoked.  However, when the user chooses to exit
            the application, the application must not exit the process.  Instead, it 
            should cleanup and return back to the command loop, calling 
            B<oaGetNextCommand()>.

    * added oaSendSignal()
        This is a general mechanism for the application to signal the
        plug-in with various events. Currently, the only supported signal is
        for rebooting the system in the middle of a benchmark run. See the
        documentation for more information.

    * added section on registering an OpenAutomate application within the
    system
        All OpenAutomate compatible apps are required to register themselves
        within the system during installation, in order to allow for quick
        identification of the applications existence.

        See "Registering an Application with OpenAutomate" in README for
        more information>.

        Also, see OpenAutomateUtil.h and OpenAutomateUtil.c for functions on
        registering, unregistering, and finding OpenAutomate enabled
        applications.

        *Note: The Win32 registry is not supported by the utility functions
        in this release.*

    * Added OpenAutomateUtil.h and OpenAutomateUtil.c
        In addition, OpenAutomateUtil.h and OpenAutomateUtil.c were added to
        the SDK. These files are not strictly required for OpenAutomate
        compatibility, but are made available to users of the SDK to use as
        they see fit.

        Currently, it the only functions included are ones related to
        application registration.

    * added option namespaces
        Options can now be enumerated by the application in a hierarchical
        fashion similar to files and directories.

        The special namespace User/ must be used to differentiate between
        options directly visible to the end-user, and ones that aren't. See
        "Registering an Application with OpenAutomate" in README for more
        information.

v0.3 - March 26, 2008
    Third alpha release.

    * Renamed SASH to OpenAutomate
        OpenAutomate is now the official name for the harness.

        All function and type prefixes are changed from sash to oa.

        Enum value prefixes are changed from SASH_ to <OA_>.

        The -sash command-line option is now -openautomate.

        All other references to SASH are changed to OpenAutomate.

v0.2 - March 9, 2008
    Second alpha release.

    * added sashAddResultValue()
        Can optionally be called at the end of a benchmark run, to
        communicate result values such as benchmark scores, tests
        passing/failing, etc...

    * added type parameter to sashAddOptionValue()
        The prototype for sashAddOptionValue() has changed from:

           void sashAddOptionValue(const SASH_CHAR *name, const sashValue *value);

        to:

           void sashAddOptionValue(const SASH_CHAR *name, 
                                   sashOptionDataType value_type,
                                   const sashValue *value);

    * now backward compatible with older plug-ins
        Previously, addition of new functions to the SASH API required
        recompilation of plug-ins to be compatible with apps that use the
        new API. This is no longer necessary.

        This matches the new sashAddResultValue(). Previously, the type of
        the value parameter was implicitely defined by the application
        through the SASH_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS command. The requirement to
        issue this command first is no longer needed. Furthermore, the
        conformance test can now check for consistency between the types in
        SASH_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS and SASH_GET_CURRENT_OPTIONS.

    * now portable to POSIX compatible OSs
        Can now be built on POSIX compatible OSs (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, ...).
        note hasn't be tested extensively, and unicode support is not robust
        yet.

        A GNUmakefile has been added, for building on these OSs.

v0.1
    First alpha release.
