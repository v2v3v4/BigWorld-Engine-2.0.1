/*~ class Math.MatrixProvider
 *	@components{ all }
 *
 *	A matrix provider is the base class for all matrices used as transforms.
 *	In many cases when the attribute of a particular object has a
 *	MatrixProvider assigned to it, it stores a reference to the original
 *	MatrixProvider, rather than creating a copy.
 *
 *	For example, in the CursorCamera, its target could be an Entity's world
 *	transformation matrix.  As the entity moves around and updates its matrix,
 *	the Camera, which stores a reference to this matrix, automatically follows
 *	along.
 *
 *	In addition, sometimes the original MatrixProvider doesn't actually store
 *	the matrix but calculates it on the fly.  For example, the DiffDirProvider
 *	provides the matrix to move from a source position to a destination
 *	position.
 *
 *	The base class has no attributes or methods.
 *
 *	The easiest way to examine the actual elements of the matrix is to create a
 *	Matrix based on the MatrixProvider.  This can be done with the following
 *	code:
 *	@{
 *	matrix = Math.Matrix( matrixProvider )
 *	@}
 *	matrix can then be interrogated using all the Matrix methods and
 *	functions.  Updating matrix	will not update matrixProvider, however.

 *	Vector4Provider rather than creating a copy.
 *
 *  Code Example:
 *  @{
 *  # This example creates a flashing light at ( 0, 10, 0 ).
 *  # The light flashes because the Vector4Provider assigned to its shader
 *  # attribute provides a dynamic Vector4, and the light uses this to
 *  # determine its colour.
 *
 *  # Import Math module
 *  import Math
 *
 *  # Create a light at positions ( 0, 10, 0 )
 *  newLight = BigWorld.PyChunkLight()
 *  newLight.position = ( i * 20, 10, 0 )
 *  newLight.outerRadius = 10
 *  newLight.visible = 1
 *
 *  # Set up a Vector4Animation, & apply it to the light.
 *  fadeV4 = Math.Vector4Animation()
 *  fadeV4.duration = 1.5
 *  fadeV4.keyframes = [ ( 0.0, ( 200, 0, 0, 0 ) ),    # red at 0.0s
 *                       ( 0.5, ( 0, 200, 0, 0 ) ),    # green at 0.5s
 *                       ( 1.0, ( 0, 0, 200, 0 ) ),    # blue at 1.0s
 *                       ( 1.5, ( 200, 0, 0, 0 ) ) ]   # red at 1.5s
 *  newLight.shader = fadeV4
 *  @}
 *
 *  When a tuple of four floats or a Vector4 is used in place of a
 *  Vector4Provider it is cast to a Vector4Basic, which is a simple static
 *  subclass of Vector4Provider. See the documentation for Vector4Basic for an
 *  example.
 *
 *  Vector4Providers can be used to provide dynamic input to PyChunkLight

/*~ class Math.Vector4Basic

 *  This is a subclass of Vector4Provider. This is a static provider, and is
 *  therefore useful when a Vector4Provider which supplies a constant is
 *  required. No factory method exists to create an instance of this class,
 *  however one is automatically created whenever a tuple of 4 floats or a
 *  Vector4 is cast to a Vector4Provider. The following example shows this in
 *  action.
 *
 *  Code Example:
 *  @{
 *  >>> # This shows how Vector4Basic objects are used by BigWorld to cast
 *  >>> # tuples of four floats and Vector4 objects to Vector4Provider instances.
 *  >>>
 *  >>> # import Math module
 *  >>> import Math
 *	>>>
 *  >>> # create a tuple of four floats
 *  >>> tuple4 = ( 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.5 )
 *  >>>
 *  >>> # create a Vector4
 *  >>> vector4 = Math.Vector4( 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.5 )
 *  >>>
 *  >>> # use both the Vector4 and the tuple of four floats as Vector4Provider
 *  >>> # objects by setting them to the source attributes of a Vector4Product
 *  >>> v4p = Math.Vector4Product()
 *  >>> v4p.a = tuple4
 *  >>> v4p.b = vector4
 *  >>>
 *  >>> # show that the Vector4 and the tuple of four floats have both been cast
 *  >>> # to Vector4Basic objects
 *  >>> print v4p.a, v4p.a.value
 *  Vector4Basic at 0x0AB298B0 (1.000000, 2.000000, 3.000000, 4.500000)
 *  >>> print v4p.b, v4p.b.value

 *  This is a subclass of Vector4Provider. This animates between the values

 *  Keyframe values are specified as a list of tuples containing a time and a
