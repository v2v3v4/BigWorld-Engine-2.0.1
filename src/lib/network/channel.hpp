 *	Channels are used for regular communication channels between two address.
 *
 *	@note Any time you call 'bundle' you may get a different bundle to the one
 *	you got last time, because the Channel decided that the bundle was full
 *	enough to send. This does not occur on high latency channels (or else
 *	tracking numbers would get very confusing).
 *
 *	@note If you use more than one Channel on the same address, they share the
 *	same bundle. This means that:
 *
 *	@li Messages (and message sequences where used) must be complete between
 *		calls to 'bundle' (necessary due to note above anyway)
 *
 *	@li Each channel must say send before the bundle is actually sent.
 *
 *	@li Bundle tracking does not work with multiple channels; only the last
 *		Channel to call 'send' receives a non-zero tracking number (or possibly
 *		none if deleting a Channel causes it to be sent), and only the first
 *		Channel on that address receives the 'bundleLost' call.
